NBT Dupe checker
What does NBT do?
First of all, NBT uses a private api AND public api to detect duped items from past/current dupes! Skytils and SBE only use a public api, which can detect less than half the amount of dupes.

NBT Dupe Checker Download:
A side mod of Skytils/Sbe, A amazing Dupe Checker. although SBE and Skyitls are better in different aspects, NBT is better overall for dupe checking, as skytils and SBE's api lacks in quality.

Why is this useful?
When buying an expensive item such as a Hyperion, many of them are duped, this mod can check for duped items to avoid you getting banned/wiped!

Is this bannable?
The short answer for this question is no. It follows all of Hypixel's rules about mod use, does not add any sort of exploitation. =
