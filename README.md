# Overview
A 1.8.9 Minecraft Forge Mod for Hypixel Skyblock which adds a high quality dupe checker to Hypixel Skyblock.

# What is the accuracy of NBT?
The average accuracy of this mod is around 96%. This is quite high, compared to Skytils and SBE, their accuracy is only around 46%.

# NBT Dupe checker
What does NBT do?
First of all, NBT uses a private api AND public api to detect duped items from past/current dupes! Skytils and SBE only use a public api, which can detect less than half the amount of dupes.

# NBT Dupe Checker Download:
You install NBT just like you install any other Forge 1.8.9 mod, download and put NBT in your mods folder! 

<!> NBT conflicts with Skytils and SBE because they use the same api!

# Why is this useful?
When buying an expensive item such as a Hyperion, many of them are duped, this mod can check for duped items to avoid you getting banned/wiped!

# Is this bannable?
The short answer for this question is no. It follows all of Hypixel's rules about mod use, does not add any sort of exploitation.
